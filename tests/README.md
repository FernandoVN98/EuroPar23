# Small cluster / Laptop Tests

There are two folders, each of the folders contains the tests for one of the applications:
- COMPSs: contains the main scripts and the code of the algorithm to run the tests for the classical COMPSs approach.
- Nested: contains the main scripts, the launchers and the code of the algorithm with the nested approach in the COMPSs frameworks.

The tests contained in these folders are small tests. These tests were developed with the unique purpose to ease the demonstration that the code is functional, without the necessity of having access to a big cluster like MareNostrum 4.
